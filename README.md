# Movies-ETL

# Purpose
    This excercise was to preform the Extraction, Transform & Load process (ETL) on 3 different data sets.  Working through each data set to confirm that they could be easily input into dataframes in Python, than transformed into dataframes with equivalent and correctly formatted variables, and lastly uploaded to a SQL database for easy reference in future.
